## ðŸ’» About Me

I'm a full-time IT Specialist in the Financial Services industry. On the side, I create all-in-one digital portfolios for small businessesâ€”custom websites, domain setup, web hosting, SEO, IMAP configuration, and Google search presence. I'm fascinated by how technology connects peopleâ€”whether through supporting business-critical systems, empowering small businesses to get online, or strengthening systems with security and reliability. With every project, Iâ€™m building a foundation I plan to grow into the broader field of cybersecurity.
